# &#x1f42f; Game Coding Camp for Autism &#x1f42f;
EdASE for Autism is a three-week camp for high school students and rising seniors on the autism spectrum (ASD) that exposes them to high-level video game development and networking with peers. Throughout the two-week camp, campers learn the high-level processes of software development, game development, interpersonal communication, collaboration, and end up with their own game, from scratch.    

This game was developed to introduce godot to the students attending this camp.
